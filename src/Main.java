// TIM UPDATED THE COURSE AGAIN SO NUMBERS ARE ALL JACKED UP
// 148/149: PhoneInterface: just implementing an Interface
// 150/151: InterfaceGameChallenge: Not much new. Sloppy code by Tim. Not sure its worth detailing
// InnerClassGearbox: Inner class. For loop method call of local method to assign values toâ€¦
        //ArrayList field in constructor. Way cool. Local class. Anonymous class. Implementing of an Interface
// PlaylistInnerClass: Outer class Album with inner class Songlist serving as ArrayList of Song objects. Factory
        // method generation of Song when passing argument to add a Song to an Album. Use of Switch/Scanner and
        // Iterator for user traversal and modification of playlist of Songs.
// AnimalClassAbstract: mixed use of interface and abstract classes/methods
//AbstractClassChallenge: use of interfacee and abstract class to create a linked list similiar to inbuilt Java
        // LinkedList with pointers. Optional use of search tree and recursive method
